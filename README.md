Investor metrics

For this project, I have used My SQL to extractthe required data from the given database using the Join function, subqueries,Aggregation, where condition, Group by,Distinct and other functions required and keeping the Primary key and foreign key in consideration provided all the reports asked by the marketing department and Investor metrics department.I have used canva for making this presentation as it contains required Elements, Graphs, Images which made this project more attractive.

From this project, I got an idea about how as a business or data analyst we work on real-time data to take any data-driven decision.

One thing I infer about this project is the dataset provided was very limited and small in respect of Rows and columns, But still, it was a very good experience working on such kind of project.

It helped me a lot to understand the analysis process well, and to provide insights for the best decision possible
